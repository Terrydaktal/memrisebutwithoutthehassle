A tool that functions like memrise but without time limits so that you can actually focus on the immersion of 8 words at a time and get time to look up ones you dont know. Memrise is also an extremely slow and laggy service, do not try to upload 17,000 words to it in the limit of 1,000 at a time bulk, which takes about 5 minutes * 17 and then you have to go through and autolearn. They changed the website and made this impossible to automate, so now that takes about 10 hours, don't bother, use this tkinter app I created that consults an excel spreadsheet.
